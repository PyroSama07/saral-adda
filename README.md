### The problem Saral Adda solves

Letâ€™s admit the current addressing system is broken and it fails at many fronts such as,
Fake Addresses
Long Addresses
A booming number of addresses
Addresses are written in different languages
Lack of uniform system
Lack of precision
This leads to failure in rapid response systems, logistics i.e., e-commerce and government services like Postal Services, census, water, and property tax.

It helps in providing:
Precision: Bhoomi code can provide precise location information for an address, which can help in delivering goods and services accurately and efficiently. The current address systems rely on street names, house numbers, and postal codes, which can sometimes be imprecise or difficult to locate.

Speed: Bhoomi code can be quickly and easily shared and communicated, reducing the time and effort needed to locate an address. This can be particularly useful in emergency situations when time is critical.

Universal: Bhoomi code can be used in any country or region, regardless of the local address system. This can be particularly helpful in countries where the current address system is unreliable, inconsistent, or non-existent.

Integration: Bhoomi code can be integrated into existing technologies and services, such as e-commerce platforms, navigation systems, and emergency services, to provide a seamless user experience.

Cost-Effective: Bhoomi code can be more cost-effective than the current address system, particularly in developing countries where the cost of implementing and maintaining a traditional address system can be prohibitively expensive.

Scalability: Bhoomi code can be scaled up or down easily, making it adaptable to changing population patterns, urbanization, and technological advances.

Sensitivity: Defense establishments, private listings and establishments are masked/avoided.
Challenges we ran into

### Security:
To mitigate concerns of data breaches, it is
pertinent that the technical architecture
of the DAC provides strict control to users
over their data.
Sensitive Areas:
Details about military/sensitive establishments
such as: ammunition bases, missile depots,
military barracks, or nuclear power plants,
Private listings and premises
should be masked and be available only to
authorised personal.
